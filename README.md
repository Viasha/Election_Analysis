## Challenge Summary
  provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
  The election commision can take advantage of this code so that it can be used to look deeper into poll results. This information can help lead to better legislations that will benefit each community or county by adjusting this code. 
  If statements can be included to  breakdown the results to zip code if the information was provided and more. This Decision Statement can be used to gather more statical analysis. This analysis can be used for future elections to come. 
  We could also add an if statment to determine the breakdown of gender if the information was provided. Knowing the gender could give you an idea of what gender preffered each candidate.
