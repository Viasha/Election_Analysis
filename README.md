## Challenge Overview
Seth and Tom, the two Board of Elections employees asked for additional information:
  1. the voter turnout for each county
  2. The percentage of voters from each county of the total count
  3. The county with the highest turnout

## Challenge Summary
  The election commision can take advantage of this code so that it can by using it to look deeper into poll results. This information can help lead to better legislations that will benefit each community or county by adjusting this code. 
  If statements can be included to  breakdown the results to zip code if the information was provided. With Decision Statements we can gather more statical analysis. This analysis can be used for future elections to come. 
  We could also add an if statment to determine the breakdown of gender if the information was provided. Knowing the gender could give you an insight on which gender preffered each candidate. 
  I believe these are very intimate groups that can be broken down to improve better community satisfaction by aligning the results with the interest of the comminuty. I believe this proposal can lead to many life changing and impactful governships.
